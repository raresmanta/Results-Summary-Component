## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned the importance of Flexbox, as well as how to use it. I also arranged some of the code better than last time. I learned to animate buttons and how to make the most of universal properties within a section.

I learned to use a bunch of classes, as well as using subclasses within css, and how to add a custom font to a page.

```css
.summary > h3 {
  font-size: 25px;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}
```


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K74l26pE4YA) - This helped me understand flexbox, which is very useful.
- [CSS in 5 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4pCqK-V_Wo) - This is an amazing video which helped me remember a lot of CSS I forgot since the last time I did any html stuff.
